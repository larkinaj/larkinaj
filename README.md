## Learning something new everyday.
Currently a Full Stack Web Developer at [OSLabs](https://www.opensourcelabs.io/). Recently came to the realization that my strengths in planning, organization, attention to detail, creativity, ability to consider alternate perspectives, and enjoyment in finding bugs would be best utilized in a development world.
